# Cryptographic Cryptid Protocols
## How to Play Cryptid with Cheaters
This repository provides an implementation of the main algorithms of our cryptid protocols.
We implement the algorithms GenClue, OpenClue, Play and Verify for the scheme CC1 and CC2, and the algorithms ProveGame and VerifyGame for the scheme VCC. We perform an average of the running time of each algorithms and an average size of the public clue key and the proofs. The mesurements allows to calculate the required storage capacity to play the game online.
